		            <p>I am currently a senior at James Madison University located in Harrisonburg, VA. I am majoring in 
		            <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/cs/">Computer Science</a> <!--Link to JMU CS-->
                    where my main interests reside in software development and as you can see from this creation of mine, web development! Currently, I am interning as a Technical Analyst at Accenture Federal this summer and I hope to use this experience to gain valuable experience that I can take with me after graduating next May. Aside from all that, this website was created over the summer of 2016 and is currently being hosted via GitHub. </p>

                    <h4>When did I begin to program?</h4>  
                      <p>Ever since I was little I have always been interested in creating things. However, between playing sports and other doing other hobbies I was never formally introduced to the area of programming until I got to college. I entered my university declared as an engineering major but quickly switched to computer science and the rest is history!</p>

                    <h4> What do I like to do in my spare time? </h4>
                      <p> Aside from academia, one of my favorite activites is playing billiards. I started serioulsy playing at the beginning of my sophomore year with friends in the billiards club. I found that it provided a nice mental break after spending large amounts of time programming and it is something I definitely plan to keep pursuing. Other than that, I generally enjoy any outdoors activity ranging from a leisurely hike to intense spelunking (I'm in caving club). Lastly but certainly not least, I am also a proud member and VP of my chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc. </p>
