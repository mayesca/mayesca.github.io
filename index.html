		            <p>I am currently a third year student at James Madison University located in Harrisonburg, VA. I am majoring in 
		            <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/cs/">Computer Science</a> <!--Link to JMU CS-->
                    where my main interests reside in software development, cyber security, and as you can see from this creation of mine, web development! As of right now my main goal is to obtain an internship by the summer of 2017 in the field of computer science. Preferably, I would like this opportunity to be located in or near the DC metropolitan area; however, I am very open to the possibility of traveling. Aside from all that, this website was created over the summer of 2016 and is currently being hosted via GitHub. </p>

                    <h4>When did I begin to program?</h4>  
                      <p>Ever since I was little I have always been interested in creating things. However, between playing sports and other doing other hobbies I was never formally introduced to the area of programming until I got to college. I entered my university declared as an engineering major but quickly switched to computer science and the rest is history!</p>

                    <h4> What do I like to do in my spare time? </h4>
                      <p> Aside from academia, one of my favorite activites is playing billiards. I started serioulsy playing at the beginning of my sophomore year with friends in the billiards club. I found that it provided a nice mental break after spending large amounts of time programming and it is something I definitely plan to keep pursuing. Other than that, I generally enjoy any outdoors activity ranging from a leisurely hike to intense spelunking (I'm in caving club).  </p>
